        <p class="aboutHG">Hyperemesis Gravidarum is not morning sickness. Want to understand more about Hyperemesis Gravidarum or HG? HG is defined as a potentially life-threatening pregnancy disease that may cause weight loss, malnutrition, dehydration, and debility due to severe nausea and/or vomiting, and may cause long-term health issues for mother and baby(ies). Signs, symptoms, and treatments for HG are shared in this comparison to morning sickness.</p>

<h3 class="dohead">Do you have morning sickness or Hyperemesis? Find out more about HG.</h3>
<p class="dopara">The criteria used to diagnose hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) often varies among health professionals and researchers. Patients who are very severe are typically hospitalized, representing the 1-3% of pregnancies estimated as having HG. However, very little research is done on the impact of hyperemesis as differentiated from morning sickness; thus the impact of HG is likely greatly underestimated. One study by Zhang, et al found a 10.8% incidence of severe vomiting, and another study found 16% of pregnant patients using antiemetics.

    <p class="dopara">There are hundreds, if not thousands, of additional people who terminate out
        of desperation when given inadequate treatment despite debilitating symptoms. Hyperemesis (HG) is not really a rare disorder.</p>

    <p class="dopara">There are hundreds, if not thousands, of additional people who terminate out
        of desperation when given inadequate treatment despite 
        debilitating symptoms. Hyperemesis (HG) is not really
         a rare disorder.</p>
<h4 class="researchhead">Research finds that the greater the severity and duration of symptoms, the greater the effect on the patient.</h4>
<div class="box-inside">
    <div class="box-text">
        <p >“A large majority (82.8%) reported that HG caused negative psychosocial changes, consisting of (1) socioeconomic changes, for example, job loss or difficulties, (2) attitude changes including fear regarding future pregnancies and (3) psychiatric sequelae, for example, feelings of depression and anxiety, which for some continued postpartum. Patients who reported that their health-care provider was uncaring or unaware of the severity of their symptoms were nearly twice as likely to report these psychiatric sequelae.”</p>

<h2 class="incidencehead">Risks and Outcomes of Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG)</h2>
<p class="dopara">Research shows that patients with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) have a higher risk of negative maternal and fetal outcomes. The greatest risk appears to be in patients who have more weight loss, severe symptoms, and/or who fail to gain weight for two consecutive trimesters. The data varies partly due to the inconsistent criteria used to diagnose and define hyperemesis (HG) and determine severity levels.</p>
<p class="dopara">Recent consensus by ICHG (International Collaboration for Hyperemesis Gravidarum) on a definition for HG will help bring uniformity to future research. 

</p>



<h2 class="incidencehead">Treatment for Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG): Medication</h2>
    <p class="dopara">One challenge with hyperemesis (HG) is weighing the risks of potential complications and misery with possible risks of anti-vomiting (antiemetic) therapies. Effective medications held until conservative measures fail delay needed treatment and may make vomiting more refractory</p>
    <p class="dopara"> There are a number of medications deemed safe with a long history of use. Yet, newer drugs often prove more effective, and do not significantly increase malformation rates. </p>

         <p class="dopara">Although medication research is increasing (e.g. ondansetron) most studies find risks to be very small. Unfortunately, published abstracts sometimes make the risk unclear. For example, one widely cited study finds a risk of cardiac defects, but the low rate doubled to less than 2%. Health professionals need to review the detailed data to determine the risks for their patients.  </p>

         <div class="smallbox-inside">
            <p>If HG patients are given early medical care enough to
                 manage their symptoms and minimize nutritional
                  deficiencies, both mother and child will be healthier 
                  now and in the future.</p>
